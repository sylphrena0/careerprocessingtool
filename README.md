# **APS Career Processing Tool**
*Author: Sylphrena Kleinsasser*

*Advisor: Midhat Farooq*

### **Description:**

This repository contains code, documentation, and data produced during my 2021 SPS Internship Program. Details on the internship program can be found [here](https://www.spsnational.org/programs/internships/interns/2021).

### **Purpose:**

This program imports and analyzes data from APS Job Board postings. It imports cleaned data with Pandas, populates and SQLite3 database, and allows lookup of certain terms in certain fields of job board postings. It also has a search module to find frequent words that might be of interest.


### **Dependencies:**
 - [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
 - [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)
 - [nltk](https://pypi.org/project/nltk/)
 - [sqlite3](https://pypi.org/project/pysqlite3/)
 - [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

### **TODO**
 - Improve performance of search module.
 - Fix GUI bugs.
 - Port documentation into markdown.
 - Add compiled apple versions.
 - Implement github releases, reorganize file structure.
 - Complete README.md with Project Structure section.
